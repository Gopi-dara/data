        Vikram is a 2022 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film written and directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj. Lokesh Kanagaraj and Rathna Kumar worked together on the dialogues in this film. It is produced by Kamal Haasan who stars in the titlular role, along with Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil with Narain and Kalidas Jayaram in the supporting roles. A spiritual successor of the 1986 film of the same name, it is the second installment in the Lokesh Cinematic Universe following Kaithi (2019). The story follows a black ops squad led by Amar, who is assigned to track down a group of ruthless vigilantes. When Amar investigates the case, he realises it is not what it seems to be, and following down this path will lead to nothing, but war between everyone involved.</P>
